<body>
If the feature is a song or hymn it should be available from the drop-down list. If it is not on the list, or is not a song or hymn then enter the details in the box below the drop-down list. If a song or hymn is not available on the drop-down list you can still use it, but please take the trouble to add it to the database using the Song Adder frame at the bottom right.<br>
You can also add some notes if you wish to (for example) describe the sequence of the song, or tell your projectionist to be ready to switch songs quickly.
