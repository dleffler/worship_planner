	You're best bet is to leave these numbers alone. If, however, you wish to insert a new feature in between two others, or move a feature from one position to another then set the feature's sequence number to the <em><b>same as</b></em> the sequence number of the feature that it is to follow. Once you submit your service plan the preview will show features in the selected order, and when you come back to the planner window the features will all be in the correct order.
